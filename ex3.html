    <p style="margin-top:40px;"><span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
      Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
